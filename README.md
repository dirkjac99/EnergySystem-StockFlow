# EnergySystem-StockFlow
This model is part of the Master's Thesis from Dirk Jacobs as part of the Industrial Ecology program at Delft University of Technology and Leiden University. The python file is a dynamic material flow analysis model (dMFA) that can be used to calculate material flows for energy systems. Model inputs are provided in the Excel file
